            The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended
            from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle playmate and
            protector within the family circle, the Rottie observes the outside
            world with a self-assured aloofness. A male Rottweiler will stand
            anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run
            a bit smaller and lighter. The glistening, short black coat with
            smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength. A
            thickly muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting
            gait. A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and
            confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof demeanor
            these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the
            playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear Rotties to their
            loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he's not a toy breed, so he is
            liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.) Early training and
            socialization will harness a Rottie's territorial instincts in a
            positive way.

            The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearence
            to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed
            primarily for hunting hare (beagling). With a grtreat sense of smell
            and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection
            dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
            around the world. The beagle is intelligent but singleminded.It is a
            popular pet due to its sizem good temper, and lack of inherited
            health problems.

            Poodles are extremely intelligent and are easily trained. They are
            agile and graceful as well as smart, and they enjoy and excel in a
            variety of canine sports, including agility, obedience, and
            tracking. They are excellent water-retrievers and also compete in
            dock diving and retriever hunt tests.

            Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German
            Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and
            high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the
            German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs
            can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in
            outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than
            angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn
            it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons
            why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but
            experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage,
            confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the
            willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones.
            German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians,
            but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does
            not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.
